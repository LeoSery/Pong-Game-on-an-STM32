## I. Presentation

Project realized during an IOT course in second year at Ynov.

The project includes:
- The source code which is on the STM32 card which allows to recover the values of the joysticks.
- A mini Pong game made with unity3D compatible with joysticks.
- An explanation of how to mount on the STM32 card and how to configure the serial output to retrieve information from the joysticks


In our project a script allows unity to retrieve the hexadecimal values of our joysticks returned by the STM32.
